 #Administrative ideas
 btc_adm_effective_territories_idea: "Not a Geographical Construct"
 btc_adm_effective_territories_idea_desc: "Land is a natural concept, many of our peoples are separate by simple linguistic, cultural or geographical barriers. However, these so called 'natural borders' often create unnecessary administrative burdens in management and pointless local councils. By rearranging our territories with sensible divisions that catter not just to geography but also politics we will be able to govern more efficiently.\n"
 btc_adm_streamlined_bureaucracy_idea: "Streamlined Bureaucracy"
 btc_adm_streamlined_bureaucracy_idea_desc: "Bureaucracy is good, it allows the state to have a tighter control on taxes, censuses, bookkeeping and overall a more defined presence of the state's officials. However, when a state grows too large a series of flaws begin to become more evident.\n\nFrom lazy tax collectors, to neverending status reports, to redundant positions in local councils, a big state becomes too much of a burden to maintain. Because of this, we must streamline our structure with a series of reforms that will seek to remove many of the more irrelevant or pointless offices and have more higher level councils that oversee tasks.\n"
 #Humanist
 btc_humanist_1: "Pragmatism"
 btc_humanist_1_desc: "Simply tolerating the different foreign peoples within our realm is not enough. As hard as it may be to admit, our people are not perfect, and foreign customs may probe valuable or even healthier ethics and lifestyles than our own. We must adapt and find the best alternatives between the different ways to approach problems and challenges so we can progress.\n"
 
 #Bureaucracy ideas
 btc_bureaucracy_corruption: "Anti-corruption laws"
 btc_bureaucracy_corruption_desc: "A bureaucratic state is often linked with corruption. The higher in number our officials grow, the more difficult it is for our authorities to keep track of all movements and avoid shady dealings and bribes.\n\nBecause of this, we must issue nation wide clear and concise laws that contemplate in detail corruption regarding government officials, so that they will think twice before committing any crime.\n"
 btc_public_administration_idea: "Public Administration"
 btc_public_administration_idea_desc: "Our bureaucracy has grown large, covering virtually all aspects of life as our officials ensure that everything is being run as expected and being kept track of. However, maintaining reliable records is not all our officials are entrusted with. If we're to have a large but also successful bureaucracy, we must implement a comprehensive public administration that is tasked with implementing the state's policies and preparing our civil servants for public service.\n\n§YUnlocks feature§!:\n§GPublic Administration§!: Gain access to new, improved edicts.\nAlso gain the following permanent, nation-wide modifiers:"

 infr_idea_5: "Cadastre"
