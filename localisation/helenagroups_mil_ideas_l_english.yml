 btc_war_cabinet_idea: "Military Committees"
 btc_war_cabinet_idea_desc: "War becomes a matter of state politics the very moment our own people are affected by it.

 #Conscription ideas
 btc_conscript_farmers_idea: "Medieval Levies"
 btc_conscript_farmers_idea_desc: "Universal military recruitment is not the only kind of conscription. Not long ago our forefathers relied completely on levies, monarchs even imposed fines to those who refused the call to arms. By looking towards the most remote areas of our realm we will find many new able-bodied men ready to fight in times of need; the farmers. Surely their families won't mind if they're conscripted for a while..\n\n§YUnlocks feature§!:\n§GConscript Farmers:§!

 btc_irregular_looting_idea_desc: "Soldiers of fortune are often raised in the harshest of environments, as such, they may grow violent or with little care for human life.

However may be, looting, pillaging and sacking prove useful to also fill our own coffers.\n"
 btc_irregular_veteran_mercs_idea: "A Soldier for Life"
 btc_irregular_veteran_mercs_idea_desc: "Mercenaries are often experienced combatants or former regular soldiers who decided to sell their combat experience, skill or manpower to interested parties.

 btc_irregular_war_exhaustion_idea: "No Conscription for Old Men"
 btc_irregular_war_exhaustion_idea_desc: "Combat experience is not the only thing mercenaries bring to the table. A mercenary in the field also means one less of our own people risking their life.

 btc_irregular_rehiring_idea: "Use and Throw"
 btc_irregular_rehiring_idea_desc: "It might sound heartless, but not having ties to many of our forces beyond payment means that we can also not care about their fate or aiding their relatives.

 btc_military_science_idea: "Military Science"
 btc_military_science_idea_desc: "How effectively and efficiently militaries accomplish their operations, missions and tasks is closely related to both the methods and the equipment and weapons they use. Because of this, we must found a national institute of war for the study of military processes, institutions, and behavior, along with the study of warfare, and the theory and application of organized coercive force.

 btc_innovative_siege_idea: "Rest for the Wicked"
 btc_innovative_siege_idea_desc: "Siege is an art of war in itself: many theories, philosophies and customs were developed for it. One of them was whether or not to allow a besieged city to surrender. Many commanders, less clever than ours, decide to loot and sack cities just to fill their own pockets, regardless of a surrender, with the consequence that other cities would then defend themselves with ever greater determination. Our commanders and soldiers are smarter, and know that if our armies have a reputation for graciously allowing surrenders, sieges will end more quickly and be less costly in lives.\n"
 btc_irregular_guerrilla_idea: "Irregular Warfare"
 btc_irregular_guerrilla_idea_desc: "Not having clear military plans or a solidified disciplined army can lead to catastrophe in every encounter.

Guerrilla warfare and tactics are as old as time, and no one better prepared than an irregular to employ them.\n"

 #Fortification ideas
 btc_improved_ditches: "Improved Ditches"
 btc_improved_ditches_desc: "With the widespread use of artillery many fortresses and walls that used to hold entire armies are becoming obsolete, even our current walls are very vulnerable to cannons. By sunking our walls into ditches fronted by earth slopes we can improve our wall's protection and make them resist better and longer, since they will absorb and disperse the energy of cannon fire."
